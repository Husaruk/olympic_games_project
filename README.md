<h2>Olympic Games Analysis</h2>

**By this analysis I want to present facts and information that are not as easily found on the internet about Olympic Games.**

**My main targets for analysis were information about Olympic games in general and information about athletes that participate in Olympic games.**

<h2>Part 1. Analysis of The Olympic Games</h2>
<h3>Questions I want to answer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Are there any sports considered irrelevant?</li>
  <li>How the number of events changed over the years?</li>
  <li>What are the differences between the Summer and Winter seasons?</li>
</ul>

**Are there any sports considered irrelevant?**

As you can see, certain sports became irrelevant since 1940. In this list, we have: Tug-Of-War, Lacrosse, Polo, Cricket, Pacquets, Motorboating, Military Ski Patrol, Croquet, Jeu De Paume, Poque, Alpinism, Basque Pelota, Aeronautics and Art Competitions which became irrelevant after 1948.

**How the number of events changed over the years?**

The visualization of sport presence in Winter shows that 40% of all Winter sports have been played since start of Winter Olympic games.

**What are the differences between the Summer and Winter seasons?**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3077d252-5f25-4006-9514-c63615c09f70)

Summer and Winter Olympic Games started at different times; the Winter Games appeared in 1924, while the Summer Games began in 1896. Until this moment, the number of events for these seasons differs by three times.

<h2>Part 2. Analysis of Athletes</h2>
<h3>Questions I want to answer</h3>
* What is the distribution of athletes across different age groups?
* What is the distribution of athletes by weight?
* How are wins distributed among different age groups?
* Top 10 ages by win rate
* Which events show the highest number of wins among athletes aged 26-31?
* Which events have the highest number of wins among athletes aged 40+?
* What differences can be observed between these two categories of athletes?

**What is the distribution of athletes across different age groups?**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5381eb4-69ae-4787-abe4-52cfbdc1cf83)

The most common age for athletes are 21-27.

**What is the distribution of athletes by weight?**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb2688f1-e185-473f-8229-526e82919133)
Notably, weights 70 kg and 75 kg have more athletes than their neighboring weights. It's worth mentioning that 71 kg has three times fewer athletes compared to 70 kg. I wanted to find out what caused such a distribution. For that I had some steps that I wanted to take and hypothesis to check.
Here is a list of steps:
<ol>
  <li>Check the number of rows with weights 70 and 71.</li>
  <li>Examine martial arts events.</li>
  <li>Round numbers for better analysis.</li>
  <li>Investigate the top 10 sports for each weight category.</li>
  <li>Create a bar plot illustrating weights over the years.</li>
</ol>

**Number of rows with weights 70 and 71**

**Examine martial arts events**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c4eb02-cdc6-4c32-9c06-affebc19b6ce)
I know that athletes in martial arts sometimes aim for the highest weight in their category to enhance their chances of winning.
However, as we can see, the difference is very small. Therefore, this hypothesis was incorrect.

**Round numbers for better analysis**
As humans, we often seek more understandable and straightforward goals. In the realm of professional sports, maintaining a physique conducive to better chances of winning is crucial. Setting a target weight of 70 kg or 75 kg before a tournament sounds like a practical goal.
However, consider the less common weights like 73 kg, 72 kg, and 71 kg – these might not be as popular targets due to their complexity. Creating tasks that are simple to understand is the initial step in the journey of achieving them.

**Investigate the top 10 sports for each weight category**

**Create a bar plot illustrating weights over the years**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74e75214-e0f1-4711-9b07-a8ed26bc002f)

Upon analyzing across different years, it becomes apparent that the presence of athletes with a weight of 70 kg consistently surpasses those with 71 kg. This pattern persists regardless of the chosen year.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06b99b3b-7faa-43df-9b69-ec4cb86d8af6)
Athletes often train with coaches, and for precise dietary calculations, they tend to use round numbers. The simplicity of round weights facilitates easier adjustments to diet and training, potentially explaining the significant difference in weights observed.

I observed that there are weight peaks for every round number (60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90). This visualization provides evidence that supports my hypothesis regarding human tendencies to round numbers and as I mentioned before, coaches can also play some part in such a result.


**How are wins distributed among different age groups?**

All the medals show a similar trend across different age groups. While there are variations in the number of medals per age, the overall patterns remain consistent.

On the visualization we saw copy of visualization ‘Number of Athletes by Age’, which leads us to the obvious conclusion the more athletes with the same age - the more wins this age will have.
The best results are observed in athletes aged 21-27, aligning with the expectation that the age when you have the best physical condition is optimal for participating in professional competitions and winning gold medals.


**Top 10 ages by win rate**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b417ea1-483f-47ba-9685-eeb9f05af479)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22969e9c-cf72-4553-aacd-47abebaf4b76)

Ages 26-31, 40, 44, 46 and 49 have a winning rate exceeding 16.4%, which is 1.7% higher than the mean value. That is why we are going to take range 26-31 for further analysis.

**Which events show the highest number of wins among athletes aged 26-31?**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58775691-0ea3-4ad3-8760-0f61a16d479e)
In this visualization, we can identify events with the best ratio of wins. As you may have already noticed, most of these events are very popular among young-mid aged people.

**Which events have the highest number of wins among athletes aged 40+?**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f7140a0-e102-433e-9817-25647ea53156)
This visualization, in contrast, features events that are less popular among young people. In my opinion, these events may require more financial resources to practice, such as Equestrianism or Sailing.

**What differences can be observed between these two categories of athletes?**
**Young group of athletes**
#1 
Young-mid aged people are more inclined to participate in popular sports, possibly due to affordability and accessibility, allowing anyone to engage in professional-level competition.
#2
Individuals in this age range typically possess optimal physical fitness, enabling them to participate in events that demand high stamina and strength.

**Older group of athletes**
#1
Athletes aged 40+ often have greater financial resources, allowing them to afford sports that may not be as accessible to younger individuals but are more affordable for the older demographic.
#2
The events listed in the last visualization appear to require less physical ability and more knowledge, making them suitable for individuals with more experience and expertise, older age group.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Years and Seasons</h3>

**Are there any sports considered irrelevant?**
Yes, there were some irrelevant sports (15 out of 66).

**How the number of events changed over the years?**
Over time, events were progressively added to the list. In the Summer season, the number changed from approximately 50 to 300 events, while in the Winter season, it evolved from around 20 to 100 events.

**What are the differences between the Summer and Winter seasons?**
The primary distinction is that Winter Olympic Games started 28 years later than Summer Olympic Games.

<h3>Athlete Statistics</h3>

**What is the distribution of athletes across different age groups?**
The most common age for athletes is 21-27.

**What is the distribution of athletes by weight?**
From 45 kg to 70 kg, athletes have the highest number of medals. Round numbers serve as peaks, leading to several conclusions:
Athletes often train with trainers and use round numbers.
People prefer simple numbers or use them as goals.
Certain weights might be more favorable for winning.

**How are wins distributed among different age groups?**
On the visualization we saw copy of visualization ‘Number of Athletes by Age’, which leads us to the obvious conclusion the more athletes with the same age - the more wins this age will have.
The best results are observed in athletes aged 21-27, aligning with the expectation that the age when you have the best physical condition is optimal for participating in professional competitions and winning gold medals.


**Is the distribution of wins aligned with the win rate for each age?**
Based on my analysis, the distribution of wins does not align perfectly with the win rate for each age. The win rate for each age group varies, and the age with the most wins doesn't necessarily coincide with the age having the highest win rate. This suggests that factors beyond the sheer number of wins contribute to the overall effectiveness or success rate within each age category.

**Which events show the highest number of wins among athletes aged 26-31?**
The events with the highest number of wins among athletes aged 26-31 are often popular young-mid aged people. Many of these events are practiced during school years and university years, providing participants with a strong foundation for various tournaments.

**Which events have the highest number of wins among athletes aged 40+?**
Athletes aged 40 and above tend to excel in events that are less popular among the younger demographic. These events often demand more skill and knowledge than sheer physical power.

**What differences can be observed between these two categories of athletes?**
Notably, there are distinct differences between athletes aged 26-31 and those aged 40+. The younger group tends to showcase strength and stamina, excelling in events popularized during school years and university years. In contrast, the 40+ category, while having fewer popular events, excels in activities requiring more skill and knowledge. In summary, the two age groups exhibit different strengths, with the younger group focusing on physical prowess and the older group emphasizing experience and expertise.
